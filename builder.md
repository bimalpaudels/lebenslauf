I want complete overhaul of the builder.

Currently the control panel is fine. I want it as is.

However the md editor and the preview are not good. I want to follow the blueprint of ohmycv.app. They have a nice editor and preview. It's monaco editor and preview. Both are responsive and clean and scroll independently. I am not sure of the othher packages involved but you can research their repo and see how they are doing it.

Remove the current editor and preview. And rebuild with the idea from ohmycv.app.
